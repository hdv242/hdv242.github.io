## What did I do this past week?

This week started out okay, and then the world flipped upside down. After my easy Kanji exam on Tuesday, I received a grim message on Canvas telling me I received a 9.5/85 on the second phase of IDB. My whole team got online and tested the site, and everything looked fine, so we were very confused on the matter. Turned out, the problem was that the link we put in the JSON for our site was missing a sneaky "s" which consequently didn't redirect properly. At least the TAs were kind enough to offer us a regrade with the updated link.

I also took my own tip from the previous week and had a friend check out our search functionality, and what do you know, within a mere minute, he found something strange. I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature, but sometimes regex seems to kick in for our search despite not yet been implemented. For example, a search for "stick" shows a result with the word "sticks" in it, but not the name "Fiddlesticks." Once, we even had a result where nothing matched with the search phrase, yet MongoDB had no issue handing it to us in a response. There's a lot happening under the hood that I haven't fully understood yet, so hopefully, nothing weird happens the TAs get around to grade our project.

## What's in my way?

Apparently, SQL is very hard. I got destroyed on most of the quizzes with SQL so far, and there aren't too many quizzes left to replace them, so I need to get all the points in the next couple of quizzes if I want to still hit the 180 point goal. 

## What will I do next week?

I have a project due for Security and some homeworks for other classes, but aside from that, it's an off-week in SWE, so I don't think next week will be too bad.

## What's my experience of the class?

It looks like we're taking a break from SQL to do some refactorings in Java (bless). I honestly feel that I'm hopeless when it comes to SQL, seeing as not even a third session over the topic with Professor Downing can help me fully grasp all the details. On paper, it doesn't seem difficult, but for some reason, when I try to write the queries myself, I blank out. Thankfully, I was never called on for any of the SQL questions in class, or it would have most certainly ended in a disaster.

See you next time!
