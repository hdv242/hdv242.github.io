title: When All Is Said and Done
---

From day one, I knew that this class would be highly detail-oriented, and that assumption held true for the entirety of the semester. This meant that in order to do well on all the quizzes, it was about knowing the nuances of the material being tested on down to the little things. Surprisingly, the readings were barely any part of the quizzes at all, since a quick skim over the articles and the bold text in the book could usually get you those questions. ~~That didn't stop me from missing them though because what is reading comprehension.~~

The tests were a little bit more difficult. Unlike my past classes, the OOP exams were entirely coding and applying the things we learned in lecture. This completely threw me off on the first exam as I spend a lot of time learning the concepts rather than practicing its application. By the second exam, I had a better hang of things. I am also not a fan of Canvas coding, as until the second exam, I didn't even know that I could extend the text box. Thus, on the first exam, I quite literally coded line-by-line since the box would only fit 2-3 lines at a time. Tabs also don't exist in Canvas, so you have to manually type out spaces to indent, and that got old really fast.

The projects were not bad at all. They don't particularly take a long time and aren't too difficult since Professor Downing typically goes over how to do the project the Monday it is released. You get the option to work with a partner for bonus points which acts as a buffer in case you missed some points on a project spec somewhere and is much more fun than solo projects. Although it was quite annoying to setup the projects each time, I thought it was a good experience. In the real world, everything isn't setup for you to just start coding. Until this semester, I didn't even know what CI or gcov was, so getting to use these new tools now was a real eye-opener that will save me lots of time to learn them later.

Throughout my college years ths far, the lectures have always been the most boring part of the course. Professor Downing had other ideas, however, as each lecture was an edge-of-your-seat experience. Really. He might call on you at any minute, and you gotta gooooo or risk embarrassing yourself as he slowly elaborates on the question, hoping you can catch the hints until he gives up hope and answers it for you. One of the things I noticed was that Professor Downing wants you to know everything very well, so he frequently corrects you to say the right thing even if he knows that you know the right thing but said something that only resembled the right thing. As a past tutor who did the same thing, I really related to this teaching style, and I deeply respect just how knowledgeable Professor Downing is in order to answer all these specific questions because talking about concepts at the base level is so much more difficult than just learning about them. 

No matter how much I like or dislike a class, at the end of the semester, I always feel a little sad that it's all going away. OOP is certainly no exception to this rule. I may have not had the most swell time in term of grades in the class, but I'd be a *gosh darn liar* if I said that I didn't learn a ton this past semester and enjoyed every bit of it. You may not know me, and you may have trouble pronouncing my name, but Professor Downing, you are one cool cat. You genuinely love what you do, and it really shows every lecture. Thank you for a wonderful semester, and I hope you continue to teach for a long time. Wouldn't you agree that everyone needs a little Downing talk in their lives?

That's it from me. Thanks for reading!
