## What did I do this past week?

Ever since the start of last week, the beginning of midterm season for me, I have been in a war against time. 

## What's in my way?

My final midterm is Monday. I don't think it would be too difficult, but I will still do my best to make sure I don't flop like this past exam. Then there's the SWE project. I'm not sure why, but my group is having a bit of trouble connecting our app to MongoDB. We have the database up and running on GCP, but no matter what we try, our backend would not connect properly. We will need to figure that out soon, or switch to a different database.

## What will I do next week?

Once I finish my final midterm, I will be mostly free for the rest of the time, and all this time will be put towards doing the SWE project. I lost a lot of time this past week to the Networks exam, so I need to make it up by working extra hard during the next few days.

## What's my experience of the class?

The class has slowed down a bit now that the exam is over. It's really cool getting to see all these SQL statements getting implemented in Python surprisingly easily.

## Pick of the week

Intro to Security has been quite an interesting class. Many of the assignments we've had in class thus far have been rather detached from the lectures, and so a bit of self-learning was required to do these otherwise trivial projects. The assignment due this week was particularly interesting, and I'm sure others in the course had discovered cooler ways to do this, but I wanted to share what I did anyways.

Did you know that you could send an email to anyone posing as anyone given access to the right SMTP server? All you need is an SMTP server that you can find via Google or on [Domain Dossier](https://centralops.net/co/domaindossier.aspx), connect to it via Telnet, and forge an email using any incoming address to any address by manipulating the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO fields. The result is something like this:

I'm even surprised that it seems to have been "signed" by UTCS's SMTP and passed by UTMail spam filter.

Now this is all very basic. If you wanted to, you could attach images and outfit your email to look to your liking. With a bit of effort, it'd look almost like the real thing. 

Have fun sending fun emails to your friends! See you next week!
