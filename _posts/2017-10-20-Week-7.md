## Pick of the week

Intro to Security has been quite an interesting class. Many of the assignments we've had in class thus far have been rather detached from the lectures, and so a bit of self-learning was required to do these otherwise trivial projects. The assignment due this week was particularly interesting, and I'm sure others in the course had discovered cooler ways to do this, but I wanted to share what I did anyways.

Did you know that you could send an email to anyone posing as anyone given access to the right SMTP server? All you need is an SMTP server that you can find via Google or on [Domain Dossier](https://centralops.net/co/domaindossier.aspx), connect to it via Telnet, and forge an email using any incoming address to any address by manipulating the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO fields. The result is something like this:

I'm even surprised that it seems to have been "signed" by UTCS's SMTP and passed by UTMail spam filter.

Have fun sending fun emails to your friends! See you next week!
