## What did I do this past week?

With the SWE exam over, the only thing left on the agenda for SWE is the second phase of IDB. But that was not the only thing remaining on the calendar for me. My Networks exam was this past Thursday, and seeing that it was 25% of my grade, I heavily prioritized it over the SWE project. Several days were spent with my friends to study for the exam, pushing the SWE project farther and farther back. The result? A devastating defeat on all fronts. I had done quite well on both my Japanese and SWE exams, but it appeared as if I had met my match. Despite the preparations I did for the exam, my understanding of the material was simply inefficient. On top of that, I have also made very little progress on IDB as a result, and now I sadly end the week with almost nothing done.

I did manage to squeeze some time to go to the Goldman Sachs talk. I thought it was pretty good. The speakers seemed more relaxed and casual than the Atlassian speakers which made the talk less formal and consequently a bit more entertaining, so I felt like I was able to get more out of it. ~~The food was also better, but that's not why we go to talks, right?~~

## What's in my way?

My final midterm is Monday. I don't think it would be too difficult, but I will still do my best to make sure I don't flop like this past exam. Then there's the SWE project. I'm not sure why, but my group is having a bit of trouble connecting our app to MongoDB. We have the database up and running on GCP, but no matter what we try, our backend would not connect properly. We will need to figure that out soon, or switch to a different database before we fall too far behind.

## What will I do next week?

Once I finish my final midterm, I will be mostly free for the rest of the time, and all this time will be put towards doing the SWE project. I lost a lot of time this past week to the Networks exam, so I need to make it up by working extra hard during the next few days.

## What's my experience of the class?

The class has slowed down a bit now that the exam is over. It's really cool getting to see all these SQL statements getting implemented in Python surprisingly easily. I have to say that I am enjoying SWE a bit more than OOP. I think it's partly having more experience with coding this past summer, so the questions Professor Downing asks in class and the little exercises we do in class seem more natural. It could also be bias because I was not compatible with the C++ wavelength in OOP.

## Pick of the week

Intro to Security has been quite an interesting class. Many of the assignments we've had in class thus far have been rather detached from the lectures, and so a bit of self-learning was required to do these otherwise trivial projects. The assignment due this week was particularly interesting, and I'm sure others in the course had discovered cooler ways to do this, but I wanted to share what I did anyways.

Did you know that you could send an email to anyone posing as anyone given access to the right SMTP server? All you need is an SMTP server that you can find via Google or on [Domain Dossier](https://centralops.net/co/domaindossier.aspx), connect to it via Telnet, and forge an email using any incoming address to any address by manipulating the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO fields. The result is something like this:

![this](images/fun.png){:class="img-responsive"}

I'm even surprised that it seems to have been "signed" by UTCS's SMTP and passed by UTMail spam filter.

![this2](images/fun2.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Now this is all very basic. If you wanted to, you could attach images and outfit your email to look to your liking. With a bit of effort, it'd look almost like the real thing. 

Have fun sending fun emails to your friends! See you next week!
