title: To Do or Not To Do?

## What did I do this past week?

This week felt very short. This was probably because there wasn't much to be done with Thanksgiving around the corner. I completed my project for Security with my group, but other than that, I can't recall anything else worth mentioning aside from attending classes.

I really liked that guest lecture over ethics. Professor Cline and Professor Rich were great presenters, and they posed some difficult questions that I had trouble answering, which just goes to show how difficult it is to truly make the right decision sometimes. Funny enough, the only two CS classes I'm signed up for next semester are Contemporary Issues and Ethical Hacking, so I'll be hearing quite a bit about this in much more detail. I'm somewhat surprised that an ethics course isn't required for certain colleges, especially one that has such an immense effect on the way people live today like CS. I understand that it's important to be a good programmer when you graduate, but I think it's just as important, if not more so, to be a good person when you enter society.

## What's in my way?

I still have 15 points to get to hit the 180 total for my quizzes. I wonder if we even have that many quizzes left. Then there are also the three final midterms that will all be in the same week with Networks and SWE on the same day. I'm not really sure how that will go, but until then, I have to work hard on the presentation for SWE.

## What will I do next week?

I'll be meeting with my group for SWE to get the project done before the break so that I can enjoy my food in peace. I also have some Networks and Security assignments to do to reduce the amount of work I have after I come back. I'll also do my best to get started on preparing for my upcoming exams because that final week of classes will not be a fun experience.

## What's my experience of the class?

As the semester comes to a close, I'm starting to appreciate those free quizzes Professor Downing handed out more and more. In total, I believe we had 6 free quizzes (3 attendance + 3 talks) which don't seem like much individually but makes up a whole 3.6 points in the final grade when evaluated together. I'm only able to hang on dearly thanks to these, and I can't imagine how difficult this portion of the class would have been without them.

After reading this week's paper, I finally saw how well-organized SWE is. We get to use a variety of tools, gain exposure to many frameworks, and even have room for self-discovery. All these things are super useful to have some experience doing before going into industry. SWE is one of those classes where you don't learn to know but rather you learn to learn.

I also love the refactorings we are doing in class. My favorite so far has been the switch replacement using the Class class on Friday. When I was implementing my framework at Amazon, I encountered that same exact issue, but I couldn't think of an elegant solution for it. I ended up leaving it as an if statement, which wasn't the worst thing in the world because there were only two choices anyways, but it certainly made the class clunky for extension if I wanted additional choices. I definitely will keep this in mind the next time.

## Pick of the week

Last week I started talking about dependency injection and one of the things I mentioned was the deferring of responsibility of creating instances to someone else. This week, I will be exploring one of the entities that makes this possible, something known as the injector. In particular, I will be using dependency injection with the Java Spring framework as my example.



See you next week!
