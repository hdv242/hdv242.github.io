# Starting from Week Zero: What did I do this past week?

Summer break has found its end, and I found myself in Professor Downing's Object-Oriented Programming course on my first day of classes in this previous half-week. I have heard and read about Professor Downing's teaching style, all of which were in positive note, so I wanted to experience this brillance first-hand. 

Let me say this: for a first lecture, it was dense. As with every programming course ever, we started with C++'s version of Hello World, despite it not actually printing Hello World. What differed was the amount of detail that we went into for every single line of in the program. Professor Downing explained not only the functionality of every line, but also its analog in Java, and for someone not at all familiar with C++, this was a godsend.

Oh, when I said Professor Downing explained the functionality of every line, I actually meant my fellow classmates tried their best to explain every line, and then he corrected or elaborated on the explanation. One of the things that I realized very early in this course is that the good professor encourages interactivity in the class by picking on random students in the audience to answer various questions we encounter in lecture. While this keeps the class engaging, it also really scares me to be under the spotlight.

On the second day of class, as we were learning about the various tools we would have to be familiar with for the class, I was one of the poor souls who was picked as tribute. I knew that the operator he asked me to identify was a pipe, but being center-stage, I could not rack my brain for CS439 information about what it did. All I could utter was a dumbfounded "Uhh." I supposed Professor Downing saw the distress on my face and quickly explained to the class what it did. Luckily, I was able to recompose myself by the time he asked me the follow-up question about grep, yet another detail I learned in 439, so I only appeared to be half a fool. At least now I'll never forget what command line pipe does!


# The First Steps I'll Be Climbing: What's in my way?

As with a few of my classmates, my biggest hurdle is to first familiarize myself with the tools for the class. Setting them up wasn't too difficult, but learning how they work is another issue, and with the first project around the corner, I have to move pretty quickly. The daily quizzes are also a little daunting, but having three other classes this semester that also have a quiz almost every day should alleviate some of the stress. (Or would that add on to the problem?!)

# The Beginning of the Real First Week: What will I do next week?

Between switching my classes around and paying a visit to the ER this past weekend, I got off to a really slow start. I haven't even gotten the textbook yet, but hopefully that will be done some time this week. I'll also be working on learning and getting all the tools ready for the upcoming project and continue doing my best on those quizzes.

# Tip of the Week

As we all know, career fair is soon approaching, and everyone is frantically trying to cram as much programming knowledge as possible to ace that interview. But do you know what is better than trying to memorize the details about the Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming from an interview help article online? Trying to memorize the details about the Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming with your friends! One of the biggest and most helpful resources for getting that internship is your colleagues. Having a little chat about what they encountered during their interview process is a lot more interactive and fun than doing all the preparations yourself, so you're more likely to retain the information. It's also beneficial to see what the working experience is like at each companies your friends have been to. I personally will be seeking out a few friends to practice interview questions and review resumes.

Anyways, that's all from me. Until next time!
