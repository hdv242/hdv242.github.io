## What did I do this past week?

As I had expected last week, this past week was a relaxing break from all the tests and projects that had piled on weeks prior. Not much happened, which gave me ample time to do my Networks project and get started on IDB3. Apparently MongoDB has built in index tables, so for the most part, we got the groundwork for the search functionality up and running in the backend. We only need to refine searches and then make them look nice on the front end.

As always, I went to the Under Armor talk this week. It went okay I guess, but that was the first time I've seen a talk go past the allotted time slot. I also got my first 0/6 this semester. It wasn't that I didn't know regex; I just somehow blanked out and forgot what [^a] did. As soon as my friend told me what it did after the quiz, I immediately got the correct answer for all three questions. This past Friday just wasn't very good to me in general. A variety of terrible things occurred, and I don't want to bore you with the details, but I will say that I am very sad that I lost my watch :(

## What's in my way?

I have a Kanji exam next week, but that's not too bad. IDB3 is also due next week, but I think we've made a considerable amount of progress to not worry too much. Other than that, I just need to make sure I keep up with classes.

## What will I do next week?

A little studying on Monday for for Kanji test followed by many hours in the lab to close out IDB3. I also need to start looking for a place to live for next year before they run out of spots.

## What's my experience of the class?

Class has been cool. This is the first time I've had such an indepth explanation of regular expressions, and considering how useful they are, I'm surprised it took this long for us to learn about them. Maybe I have been taking the wrong classes all this time.

## Pick of the week



 See you next time!
