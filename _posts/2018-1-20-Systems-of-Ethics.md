title: Systems of Ethics R1

## Three-choose-one
With graduation fast approaching, I find myself in my last semester taking an ethics course as well as Ethical Hacking which, as the course instructor put it, is only ethical by name "because just 'Hacking' doesn't seem like a good name for a course." Throughout my college years in CS, I rarely saw mention of anything related to ethics, aside from the per-course reminder about academic dishonesty. But after lecture on Friday, I began thinking through which tinted lens of ethics do I see the world. After much self-deliberation, I settled upon the duty-based ethic system.

## Deontology, a Brief History
The duty-based ethics system is also known as deontology, derived from the Greek word *deon*, meaning duty. It is one in which participants are morally obligated to behave in a way that is considered moral by some set of principles without regards to the consequences that result from these actions. Essentially, the emphasis of the morality of actions lies on the means rather than ends, even if morally wrong acts can lead to favorable outcomes or vice versa.

Perhaps the most famous proponent of this system is Immanuel Kant who wrote the *Groundwork of Metaphysics of Morals* in 1788. In the book, Kant formulates three categorical imperatives which denote absolute requirements to be followed in all situations. The first states that one should "act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become law without contradiction", more commonly known as the Golden Rule. The second states that one should "act in a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end", that the way you treat a person should not simply be a means but also an end. The third states that "every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends". In other words, act in a way such that others who do the same will still be considered moral.

## Dentology in Practice
On the surface, deontology provides unconditional rules to follow when faced with a decision. These decisions can be evaluated individually, a more straightforward approach than predicting outcomes. For example, if you find yourself deciding whether or not to steal a loaf of bread, you would immediately realize that this would violate the first categorical imperative. Even if the decision to steal may cause you to be sent to jail, or the decision to not steal may cause you to starve for a day, the decision is still simple because the mere act of stealing itself is morally wrong. On the other hand, deontology allows for the possibility where the net good of the world decreases due to following an action that is considered moral. Suppose a person steals the old loaves of bread that no one wants to feed his family. If he is incarcerated because it is wrong to steal, how will his family carry on?

## Final Thoughts
Morality is not well-defined enough to be truly explained by a single system of ethics. No matter how we try to categorize what is right and what is wrong, there will always be exceptions. Even as I write about the duty-based ethics system, I cannot help but notice that there would be certain decisions where I would have to also consider the ends in addition to the means. If morality was clear-cut, there would be only a single system that dictates exactly what should be done in every situation, but if that was the case, this would not be an assignment.
